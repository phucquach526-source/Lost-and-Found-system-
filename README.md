# Lost-and-Found-system-
Our team are going to create a web application that serve as a lost and found system. User will be able to report their lost object by creating a post with their own contact info, item names, description, data and location lost, as well as an image of the item. The people who found their object can connect to the user through phone number or other form of social media and give the object back to the owner. In addition, the finder can also create a post regarding their found object.
